###### I thought of researching some tips on how to organize my team for the upcoming Hackathon. 
###### I found these tips by [Andrew Van Tassel](http://www.andrewvantassel.com/), who participated in many hackathons and won prizes in many of them.
###### I forked these beautiful slides made with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) which also have a [speaker view](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) to help you present your hack.
